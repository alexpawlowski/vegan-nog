# vegan-nog
Simple recipe for vegan-nog. modified from [Simple Vegan](http://simpleveganblog.com/simple-vegan-eggnog/)

Serves: `3-6`

I generally multiply by 2 for ~ about 10 drinks / amount.

## Ingredients

- [x] 1 15-ounce of `unsweetened almond milk` (400 ml)
- [x] ½ cup raw `cashews` (65 g)
- [x] ¼ cup `water` (65 ml)
- [x] 3 tbsp `maple syrup`
- [x] ¼ tsp `ground nutmeg`
- [x] ¼ tsp `ground cinnamon`
- [x] your choice of `rum` or `tequila`. ¿Por qué, no los dos? . `Tequila with nog is fantastic.`

## Instructions

- Soak the `cashews` overnight or for at least 1 hour.
- Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. 
- If guests don't like cashews clump, use a coffee filter to filter out the clumps that may be left over

## Snide Comments

- Have tried with cashew milk instead of almond milk. Not as good. 
- You can use coconut milk, as well to make creamier, but I'm not trying to kill my guests with all of that sat fat.
